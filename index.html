<h3>Welcome to Give Studios</h3>
<p>Give Studios is a virtual studio consisting of developers and designers. The studio creates Windows Phone and Windows 8 applications which are published on the marketplace. 
The goal of the studio is to combine the passion to create new applications with the desire of to give back to the community. We do so by one of two ways</p>
<ol>
<li>Create and publish paid apps on the marketplace. A major portion of app purchase revenue is donated to local NGOs. The apps are not limited to any specific domain or category and can span the entire marketplace, including utilities, games, productivity, tools and more.</li>
<li>Create and publish community oriented apps. Typically, these apps target specific community needs and are free apps. For example, applications that assist people with disabilities like vision impairment.</li>
</ol>
<p>
GiveStudios is sponsored by Microsoft. The sponsorship provides the logistics and technical framework for the apps being developed and published. 
</p>


<h3>Studio membership</h3>

<p>Give Studios is sponsored by Microsoft but is open to the developers and designers community. Anyone who can contribute is welcome to join at take part in the creation process. We have a public web site under <a href=http://givestudios.net>http://givestudios.net</a> where we host our community and allow new members to join.</p>

<h3>The projects</h3>
<p>
The studio consists of many members across several disciplines and operates multiple projects in parallel. The studio community members decide on new projects and form up in groups in an autonomous way with no control or governance from the studio. The studio provides the framework for the community to share ideas and discuss needs and solutions. The studio is offering the logistics backbone that enables project groups to effectively ship applications and successfully divert revenues to community needs.
